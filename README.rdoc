== DESCRIPTION:

Plist is a library to manipulate Property List files, also known as
plists.  It can parse plist files into native Ruby data structures as
well as generating new plist files from your Ruby objects.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Parse XML plists
* Serialize Ruby collections as XML plists

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Generation

  hsh = {
    'FirstName' => 'John',
    'LastName'  => 'Public',
    'ZipPostal' => '12345'
  }

  File.open( 'path/to/example.plist', 'w' ) do |file|
    file.puts hsh.to_plist
  end

=== Parsing

  result = Plist::parse_xml('path/to/example.plist')

  result.class
  => Hash

  "#{result['FirstName']} #{result['LastName']}"
  => "John Public"

  result['ZipPostal']
  => "12345"

== REQUIREMENTS:
